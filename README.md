# To-do-list-with-javascript.
I'm creaing a webpage of To-do list using javascript and bootstrap.

In this project, you can add,edit,complete,delete,etc. 

The important thing of this project is your data will always be safe even you refresh, reload or delete the page.
Because here we are using local storage of browser.
